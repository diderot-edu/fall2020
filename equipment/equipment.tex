\section{Microphone}

Having a good microphone is extremely important for remote teaching. 
%
If the camera quality is a bit off, human beings can often adjust.
%
But poor audio quality is often a deal breaker.
%
It is therefore very important to pick the right microphone.
%
Perhaps, the most important consideration is whether you want to have a
multi-directional  or a more focused, possibly unidirectional microphone.

\subsection{Blue Snowball iCE Mic for Recording \& Streaming}

\begin{gram}

\textbf{Overview}

This is an Omnidirectional Microphone. If you plan to move around the
space, e.g., between a chalk/marker board, screen, an omnidirectional
microphone like the Blue Snowball is a good option.
%
The disadvantage of this microphone is that it will pick up noise from the surrounding space.
%
If you don't have a quiet office (e.g., expect dogs barking, traffic noise, etc), then this microphone is not the best choice.  
%
You might want to choose a lapel microphone or something more directional.

\subsection{Samson Lapel Mic}

\begin{gram}

\textbf{Overview}

If you expect to have noise from the surrounding when you are teaching
(your office receives traffic noise, there are multiple people sharing
the same office space, etc), then you will want to have a
directional microphone.  
%
In our tests, we have found that a lapel microphone is best for this purpose.

\subsection{Blue Yeti}

\begin{gram}
If you don't want to use a Lapel Microphone and you have a relatively
noisy office, then you want to consider a directional Microphone like Blue Yeti.
%
This is not a omni-directional microphone, so it will not work well if you plan to move about a lot, e.g., between a whiteboard and your computer.  
%
But if you are planning on being mostly stationary, this microphone is excellent.

\textbf{Where to buy}

You expect to pay about 130 dollars for this microphone.  If you use Amazon to do your purchase, then you might find that the price is a lot higher, because of Amazon's dynamic pricing.  Please try other web sites such as
