\section{Microphone}
\label{sec:equipment::mics}

\begin{gram}[How to choose a Mic?]
\label{grm:equipment::mics::how}
Having a good microphone is extremely important for remote teaching. 
%
If the camera quality is a bit off, your audience  can often adjust.
%
But poor audio quality is usually a deal breaker.
%
Therefore, it is important to pick the right microphone and learn how to use it. 
%
Perhaps, the most important consideration is whether you want to have a
omni-directional or a more focused (unidirectional) microphone.
%
For our purposes here we will consider cardioid focused
microphones, which pick up the voice from the front and a bit from the
side, but very little from the back.  This allows you to move around a
bit but it does not pick up extra noise from the surrounding.
%
\end{gram}

\begin{gram}[Comparison between various Microphones]
\label{grm:equipment::mics::comparison}
Here is a sample video that Nikolas Martelaro over in the HCII made showing the differences between microphones when streaming with Zoom. In the video he tests a lavalier mic, the built-in mics on his MacBook Pro and Logitech webcam, and a high-quality cardioid mic.

\end{gram}

\subsection{Blue Snowball iCE Mic}
\label{sec:equipment::bluesnow}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:equipment::bluesnow::overview}

\textbf{Overview}

This is an Omnidirectional Microphone. If you plan to move around the
space, e.g., between a chalk/marker board, screen, an omnidirectional
microphone like the Blue Snowball or a lapel microphone are good
options.
%
The disadvantage of this microphone is that it will pick up noise from the surrounding space.
%
If you don't have a quiet office (e.g., expect dogs barking, traffic noise, etc), then this microphone is not the best choice.  
%
You might want to choose a lapel microphone or something more directional.

\subsection{Samson Lapel Mic}
\label{sec:equipment::samsonlapel}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:equipment::samsonlapel::main}

\textbf{Overview}

If you expect to have noise from the surrounding when you are teaching
(your office receives traffic noise, there are multiple people sharing
the same office space, etc), then you will want to have a
directional microphone.  
%
In our tests, we have found that a lapel microphone is best for this purpose.

\subsection{ModMic}
\label{sec:equipment::modmic}

\begin{gram}
\textbf{Overview}
Another option for focused audio is to use a headset mic. Headset mics put the microphone right near your mouth.
This allows you to reduce the gain and prevent picking up background noise.
Typically, headset mics result in high quality audio capture but have a few downsides.
\begin{itemize}
\item The gain must be tuned so that your voice does not ``clip'' and cause the audio to become very loud and noisy. 
\item the mic should be position far enough away so that you avoid ``popping.'' This is that breathy and loud sound you hear when you say `P's' and the audio pops. This can usually be avoided by placing the mic about 1 - 2 inches (25 - 50 mm) from the \textit{corner} of your mouth.
\item Some people do not like the look of a mic across their face. Some people do not mind and kinda like the NASA control room look.
\end{itemize}

If you like using over the ear headphones, you can purchase headphones with built in headset mics. These are often found in gaming headsets.

If you already have headphones that you like and would like to add a headset mic, the ModMic is a nice option. 

The ModMic comes in different configurations including wireless Bluetooth, USB, and analog (3.5mm). The ModMic has a magnet that let's you quickly attach the mic to the side of your over-the-ear headphones.

\subsection{Fifine K670}
\label{sec:equipment::fifine}

\subsection{Blue Yeti}
\label{sec:equipment::blueyeti}

\begin{gram}
\label{grm:equipment::blueyeti::main}
%
Blue Yeti as multi-dimensional microphone.
%
It is optimized for focused (cardioid) use like the Fifine K670
but it also allow you to broaden directionality to includes the sides
and the back, moving towards an omnidirectional microphone.
%
It does not do a good job, however, with the omnidirectional use, and we don't recommend this microphone if you plan to move about a lot as you teach.
%
But if you are planning on being mostly stationary, this microphone is excellent and is considered to be the benchmark.
%
In practice and in uni-directional use the difference between this and
the Fifine K670 is small.  Fifine is also a bit simpler with fewer knobs to turn and thus fewer things to go wrong.  Blue yeti is quite a bit larger than Fifine.
