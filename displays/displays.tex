\section{Pen Display}

For effective remote lectures, having some display space for drawing and writing things can be very important.  When lecturing in a classroom, the lecturer typically has access to a white or a chalk  board for this purpose.

Tablet computers such as iPad and Surface work reasonably well in many cases but in some lectures, a bigger space may be helpful and even necessary. 
%
We recommend using a Wacom Pen Display for this purpose.
