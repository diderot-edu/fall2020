\chapter{White Boards and other Equipment for the TAs}

\begin{gram}[Supplies for Teaching Assistants]
We recommend each instructor to talk to their TAs and supply them with
some remote-teaching equipment that can be used for recording recitation videos and holding office hours.  
%
Specifically, here, we are focusing on whiteboards and tripods that can be supplied to one or several of your TAs.

\begin{gram}[Whiteboards]

The students prefer to see more that just the face of their
instructors in recitations and office hours. 
%
As an instructor or a TA, you might want to use a small portable
whiteboard in your recitations and office hours along with a camera
and microphone that can capture the board along with you. 
%
We recommend using a small 3 feet by 2 feet whiteboard.  
%
If you have a place such as desk or a fireplace mantel or a desk, then
you can simply place the whiteboard on it.  If you don't have such a
stable surface, you might want to consider getting a whiteboard with a
stand.
%
We note that we have found the simple whiteboard without the stand to
be more practical, because it requires less space to store and because
it provides for different modes of use, e.g., in upright and landscape
mode.


\textbf{Where to buy and budget}
These are broadly available but are usually not free-shipping unless you buy a few of them.  As an instructor,  you can talk to your TAs, assess the need, and purchase several of these at once to be shipped to one place to be (safely) distributed between to your TAs.

\section{Tripods and Stands}

We recommend all TAs to purchase a tripod stand. This would allow them to use their mobile phones for recording lectures and as a document camera.  
%
Because these items are reusable, we expect each TA to purchase on their own.
%
But if you are teaching a large recurring course such as CS first and
second your courses, then you can purchase a few of the more expensive
ones and see that they are passed from one TA to another.
%
Here are the recommended tripods.
