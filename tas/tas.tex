\chapter{TA Recitations and Office Hours}

\begin{gram}[Whiteboards and Easels]

The students prefer to see their instructors in recitations and office
hours. As a TA, you might want to use a small portable whiteboard in
your recitations and office hours.  We recommend a small 3 feet by 2
feet whiteboard.  If you have a place such as a fireplace mantel or a
desk, then you can simply place the whiteboard on it.  If you don't
have such a stable surface, you might want to consider buying an
easel.

You can get a 3x2 whiteboard and a sturdy easel each for less that \$25.
